# CMPS109Project
This is a programming project that is designed to let you utilize all the concepts and apply all the libraries, tools, and advanced programming techniques explained in class to build a middleware for the Simple Rule-Base Inference Engine (SRI), which is in the form of a virtual machine capable of inferencing simple logic. The project is composed of four phases, where each phase depends on the preceding ones. It is required also to conduct a UML Object Oriented Design and maintain it by performing constructive updates to it through out the development and the buildup of the middleware.
